# Criminal procedure

## Criminal procedure: types of crime

- Felonies

        - serious crimes
        - punishable by prison time
        - punishable by more than one year of incarceration
        - prison or state jail incarceration
        - violent crimes such as assault, murder, robbery, and sexual assault
        - serious property crimes such as burglary, grand theft
        
- Misdemeanors

        - minor crimes punishable by less than a year in jail 
        - jail time served in local jails, not prison
        - misdemeanors range from petty theft to minor traffic violations (which are class C misdemeanors in Texas)
        
## Elements of crime

- Set by statute
- Prosecution must allege and prove all elements of the crime
- Many crimes require *mens rea,* literally "guilty mind" or criminal intent
- Crimes that do not require *mens rea* are strict liability crimes


## Due Process

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
The major assumption of US and Texas criminal law is that protection of innocent citizens from false accusations and imprisonment is the most important consideration.

Which is worse - falsely imprison someone or mistakenly release a guilty person?

## Due Process

> It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.

        - William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, 
        
> It is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer.

        - Benjamin Franklin
        
        


## Due Process of Law

- Due process is guaranted by the Texas Constitution
- Due process is guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution
- Due process includes reasonable searches

        - evidence from illegal searches must be excluded from evidence
        
        
## Due Process of Law
        
- Due process at arrest:

        - arrest requires a warrant or probable cause to believe the arrestee committed a crime
        - individuals arrested must be informed of certain basic rights
        
- Due process and confessions

        - confessions can not be coerced
        - a suspect must have been informed of their rights under Mirana v. Arizona
        
        
## Arraignment

- Arraignment is an initial court appearance
- The defendant is informed of the charges against them
- If the defendant cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed
- Bail, if any, is set at arraignment


## Pre-trial

- In felony cases, a grand jury will bring an indictment if there is sufficient evidence
- In other cases, a writ of information will be used
- After indictment, there will be a pre-trial hearing
- Most cases end with a plea bargain 


## Trial

- Defendants are entitled to trial by jury in felony cases
- Defendants may choose a bench trial
- The prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt
- The defense may present evidence
- The defendant is entitled to subpoena witnesses
- Guilt or innocence

        - If the jury finds the defendant not guilty, this is final
        - If the jury finds the defendant guilty, the judge can set aside the verdict
        
        
## Post Trial (Post conviction)
        
- Sentence

        - Juries may pass sentence in some crimes
        - Judges may impose a lower sentence than the jury
        - Often judge will receive a pre-sentence report
        
- Appeal

        - Defendants may appeal a conviction
        - Appeals are based on legal errors, not factual disputes
        - Appeals are heard by appellate courts, not trial courts (limited exceptions)
        
        

## What is the purpose of the criminal justice system?

- Protecting the people

        - all the people
        - victims
        - the falsely accused


## Protecting the convicted

- Why would we protect the convicted?

- For example, the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment? 

- Prohibition on excessive fines?



## Protecting the convicted

- We are protecting ourselves

- government acts on our behalf, so if government acts unjustly they have done it in our name

- a civilized society is one that uses the lowest possible level of organized violence (Krauthammer, *Things That Matter*)




## What is the purpose of the criminal justice system?

- *Protecting the people*
- Punishment of the guilty as justice and to deter crime



## What is the purpose of the criminal justice system?

- *Protecting the people*
- Punishment of the guilty as justice and to deter crime
- Rehabilitating the convicted to return to society


## Criminal justice reform

- focus more on rehabilitation

        - more humane
        - more effective
        
        
- reduce or eliminate bail

        - high bail makes poverty a crime
        - innocent people may spend months jailed awaiting trial
