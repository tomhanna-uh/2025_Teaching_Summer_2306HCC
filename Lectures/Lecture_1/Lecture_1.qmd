## Lecture vs Textbook

- The lecture is not a substitute for the textbook
- The textbook is not a substitute for the lecture
- The textbook provides a description of institutions and concepts in the American system
- The lecture will focus heavily on background, context, why things matter, and the comparison of Texas to federal government

## Lecture and Activities

- What is government and what is politics? 
- What are the ethical consequences of the nature of government? Why do we need to limit government in a democracy/why limit majorities?
- How does federalism help avoid tyranny? What does it offer to improve the dignity and integrity of the individual?

## Lecture Overview

- Priorities in the US and Texas Constitutions
- How the history of Texas - not always good - contributed to positive aspects of the Texas Constitution that benefit everyone in Texas today
- Discussion of what can be improved today
- Texas, Houston, and Harris County politics and government

## Lecture Overview

- How to become an informed citizen and voter in Texas
- How to become an effective user of government services in Texas and advocate for those you care about

        - Who do you call for a pothole?
        - Who do you call for problems with local law enforcement? Does it depend on the problem?
        - Should you write a letter to Ted Cruz about a local matter like...the Texas electric grid?
        - Can John Whitmire do anything about grandma's Social Security check?


        
## Major course expectations

- I do not expect you to be experts on the course material at the end
- I do expect you to:

        - Respect other people, starting with your classmates and myself
        - Do the work
        - Do your best
        - Take responsbility for the work you did or not do
        - Take some time to seriously consider the implications of the material for your own life and the lives of people you care about
        - Come to class prepared
        
        
        
## Come to class prepared

- To receive full credit for the in class work each day (20% of your grade), you must come to class prepared
- Part of this means at least reviewing the assigned chapter
- Completing the Journal assignments as schedule will help with this, with doing well on the exams, and with understanding the material
- If discussion reflects that people are prepared, we will not have to have quizzes and everyone will get full credit
- If discussion is bad, there will be quizzes or people who are not prepared may lose credit

## Study suggestions: The forgetting curve

![The Forgetting Curve](forgetting_curve.png)

## Conquer the Forgetting Curve

- Study a few minutes a few times a week instead of 6 hours right before the test
- Start the Inquizitives early (see Syllabus for suggestions) 

        - You have several weeks to do each set of 3 to 6 chapter assignments
        - Finish them ahead of schedule then use them to study by...
        - Revisiting the Inquizitives several times between finishing them and the exam to review
        
- Use the Flashcards a few minutes, a few times a week

## Use a good notetaking system

- Use the lecture slides to organize your notes

        - Do not take pictures of the slides - they are published in Canvas with a PDF download option available
        
- Try rewriting concepts in your own words

        - If you don't understand something, use the index in the book to find more
        - Use a reputable dictionary such as https://www.merriam-webster.com/ or https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/ to look up words you don't understand
        - Come to office hours and ask
        - Ask in class
        
## Use a good notetaking system
        
- Use a good notetaking system such as [Cornell Notes](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/C)

- Make a study guide: Making a study guide yourself (using a system like Cornell Notes) is much more effective than staring at a study guide prepared for you
        
- Take advantage of the Practice Exams *after you do these other things*
